Ollivander,Very curious.,1
Harry,Sorry  but what's curious?,1

Ollivander,It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand  gave another feather.,1
Ollivander,Just one other.,1
Ollivander,It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. ,1
Harry,And who owned that wand?,1
Ollivander,We do not speak his name.,1
Ollivander,The wand chooses the wizard  Mr. Potter.,1
Ollivander,It's not always clear why.,1

Hagrid,But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.,1
Hagrid,Nobody  not one.,1
Hagrid,Except you.,1
Harry,Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?,1
Hagrid,Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead  Harry.,1
Hagrid,A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse  and an evil curse at that.,1
Harry,What happened to V...?,1
Harry,To You-Know-Who?,1
Hagrid,Well  some say he died.,1
Hagrid,Codswallop  in my opinion.,1

Percy,Hello  Sir Nicholas.,1
Percy,Have a nice summer?,1
Sir Nicholas,Dismal. Once again  my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.,1
Ron,I know you.,1
Ron,You're Nearly Headless Nick.,1
Sir Nicholas,I prefer Sir Nicholas  if you don't mind.,1
Hermione,Nearly headless?,1
Hermione,How can you be nearly headless?,1
Sir Nicholas,Like this.,1
Percy,Gryffindors  follow me please.,1
Percy,Keep up. Thank you.,1
Boy,Ravenclaw  follow me. This way.,1
Percy,This is the most direct path to the dormitories.,1
Percy,Oh  and keep an eye on the staircases.,1
Percy,They like to change.,1
Percy,Keep up  please  and follow me.,1
Percy,Quickly now  come on. Come on.,1
Neville,That picture's moving.,1
Ron,Look at that one.,1
Harry,I think she fancies you.,1
Girl,Oh  look! Look!,1
Girl,Who's that girl?,1
Man in paint,Welcome to Hogwarts.,1
Fat Lady,Password?,1
Percy,Caput Draconis.,1
Percy,Follow me  everyone. Keep up.,1
Percy,Quickly  come on.,1
Percy,Gather around here.,1
Percy,Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.,1
Percy,Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.,1
Percy,Girls  the same on your right.,1
Percy,You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.,1
Ron,Made it!,1
Ron,Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?,1
Ron,That was bloody brilliant!,1
McGonagall,Thank you for that assessment  Mr Weasley.,1
McGonagall,Perhaps  lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.,1
McGonagall,That way  one of you might be on time.,1
Harry,We got lost.,1
McGonagall,Then perhaps a map?,1
McGonagall,I trust you don't need one to find your seats.,1
Snape,There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.,1
Snape,As such  I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.,1
Snape,However  for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses.,1
Snape,I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death.,1
Snape,Then again  maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention.,1
Snape,Mr. Potter.,1
Snape,Our new celebrity.,1
Snape,Tell me  what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?,1
Snape,You don't know? Well  let's try again.,1
Snape,Where  Mr Potter  would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?,1
Harry,I don't know  Sir.,1
Snape,And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?,1
Harry,I don't know  Sir.,1
Snape,Pity.,1
Snape,Clearly  fame isn't everything is it  Mr. Potter?,1
Harry,Clearly  Hermione knows.,1
Harry,Seems a pity not to ask her.,1
Snape,Silence.,1
Snape,Put your hand down  you silly girl!,1
Snape,For your information  Potter,1
Snape,Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.,1
Snape,A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.,1
Snape,As for monkshood and wolfsbane  they are the same plant  which also goes by the name of aconite.,1
Snape,Well...,1
Snape,Why aren't you all copying this down?,1
Snape,And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek.,1
Seamus,Eye of rabbit  harp string hum,1
Seamus,Turn this water into rum.,1
Seamus,Eye of rabbit...,1
Harry,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?,1
Ron,Turn it into rum. ,1
Ron,Actually managed a weak tea yesterday  before...,1
Ron,Mail's here.,1
Harry,Can I borrow this? Thanks.,1
Dean,Hey  look! Neville's got a Remembrall,1
Hermione,I've read about those.,1
Hermione,When the smoke turns red  it means you've forgotten something.,1
Neville,The only problem is  I can't remember what I've forgotten.,1
Harry,Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.,1
Harry,Listen.,1
Harry,"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach  insist nothing was taken.",1
Harry,"The vault in question  number 713  had  in fact  been emptied earlier that very same day.""",1
Harry,That's odd. ,1
Harry,That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.,1
Madam Hooch,Good afternoon  class.,1
Class,Good afternoon  Madam Hooch.,1
Madam Hooch,Good afternoon  Amanda.,1
Madam Hooch,Good afternoon.,1
Madam Hooch,Welcome to your first flying lesson.,1
Madam Hooch,Well  what are you waiting for? ,1
Madam Hooch,Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick.,1
Madam Hooch,Come on now  hurry up. ,1
Madam Hooch,"Stick your right hand over the broom and say  ""Up.""",1
Class,Up!,1
Malfoy,Up.,1
Ron,Up. Up!,1
Madam Hooch,With feeling.,1
Hermione,Up. Up. Up!,1
Ron,Shut up  Harry.,1
Madam Hooch,Now  once you've got hold of your broom  I want you to mount it.,1
Madam Hooch,And grip it tight  you don't wanna be sliding off the end.,1
Madam Hooch,When I blow my whistle  I want each of you to kick off from the ground  hard.,1
Madam Hooch,Keep your broom steady  hover for a moment,1
Madam Hooch,Then lean forward slightly and touch back down.,1
Madam Hooch,On my whistle. Three  two...,1
Madam Hooch,Mr. Longbottom.,1
Madam Hooch,Mr. Longbottom!,1
Neville,Down  down!,1
Class,Neville!,1
Madam Hooch,Come back down this instant!,1
Madam Hooch,Everyone out of the way!,1
Girl,Is he all right?,1
Madam Hooch,Oh  dear  it's a broken wrist.,1
Madam Hooch,Poor boy. Come on now  up you get.,1
Madam Hooch,Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.,1
Madam Hooch,Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say  Quidditch.,1
Malfoy,Did you see his face?,1
Malfoy,Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze  he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.,1
Harry,Give it here  Malfoy.,1
Malfoy,No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.,1
Malfoy,How about on the roof?,1
Malfoy,What's the matter  Potter?,1
Malfoy,Bit beyond your reach?,1
Hermione,Harry  no way!,1
Hermione,You heard what Madam Hooch said.,1
Hermione,Besides  you don't even know how to fly.,1
Hermione,What an idiot.,1
Harry,Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!,1
Malfoy,Is that so?,1
Malfoy,Have it your way  then.,1
Boy,Nice going  Harry.,1
Boy,That was wicked  Harry!,1
McGonagall,Harry Potter!,1
McGonagall,Follow me.,1
McGonagall,You wait here.,1
McGonagall,Professor Quirrell  excuse me.,1
McGonagall,Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?,1
Quirrell,Oh  yes  of course.,1
McGonagall,Potter  this is Oliver Wood.,1
McGonagall,Wood  I have found you a Seeker.,1
Sir Nicholas,Have you heard? ,1
Sir Nicholas,Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. ,1
Sir Nicholas,I always knew hed do well.,1
Ron,Seeker? ,1
Ron,But first years never make their house teams! ,1
Ron,You must be the youngest Quidditch player in,1
Harry ,A century  according to McGonagall.,1
Fred  ,Hey  well done  Harry  ,1
Fred  ,Wood's just told us!,1
Ron  ,Fred and George are on the team  too. ,1
Ron  ,Beaters.,1
George  ,Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. ,1
George  ,Can't make any promises  of course. ,1
George  ,Rough game  Quidditch.,1
Fred  ,Brutal. ,1
Fred  ,But no one's died in years. ,1
Fred  ,Someone will vanish occasionally  ,1
George  ,But they'll turn up in a month or two!!,1
Ron  ,Oh  go on  Harry  ,1
Ron  ,Quidditch is great. ,1
Ron  ,Best game there is! ,1
Ron  ,And you'll be great  too!,1
Harry  ,But I've never even played Quidditch. ,1
Harry  ,What if I make a fool of myself?,1
Hermione,You won't make a fool of yourself. ,1
Hermione,It's in your blood.,1
Ron  ,Whoa. ,1
Ron  ,Harry  you never told me your father was a Seeker  too.,1
Harry  ,I-I didn't know.,1
Ron  ,I'm telling you  it's spooky. ,1
Ron  ,She knows more about you than you do.,1
Harry  ,Who doesn't?,1
Ron  ,Ahh!,1
Harry  ,What's happening?,1
Hermione  ,The staircases change  remember?,1
Harry,Let's go this way.,1
Ron ,Before the staircase moves again. ,1
Ron,Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?,1
Hermione,We're not supposed to be here. ,1
Hermione,This is the 3rd floor.,1
Hermione,It's forbidden.,1
Harry  ,Let's go.,1
Ron  ,It's Filch's cat!,1
Harry  ,Run! Quick  let's hide through that door!,1
Harry,It's locked!,1
Ron  ,That's it  we're done for!,1
Hermione  ,Oh  move over! ,1
Hermione,Alohomora,1
Hermione,Get in,1
Ron,Alohomora?,1
Hermione ,Standard book of spells  Chapter 7.,1
Filch,Anyone here  my sweet? Come on.,1
Hermione ,Filch is gone.,1
Ron ,Probably thinks this door's locked.,1
Hermione , It was locked.,1
Harry  ,And for good reason. ,1
All  ,AHHHHHHH! ,1
Ron ,What do they think they're doing?? ,1
Ron ,Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,1
Hermione , You don't use your eyes  do you? ,1
Hermione ,Didn't you see what it was standing on?,1
Ron  ,I wasn't looking at its feet! ,1
Ron  ,I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. ,1
Ron  ,Or maybe you didn't notice  there were three!,1
Hermione  ,It was standing on a trap door. ,1
Hermione  ,Which means it wasn't there by accident. ,1
Hermione  ,It's guarding something.,1
Harry  ,Guarding something?,1
Hermione  ,That's right. ,1
Hermione  ,Now  if you two don't mind  I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse  expelled!,1
Ron  ,She needs to sort out her priorities!,1
Oliver ,Quidditch is easy enough to understand. ,1
Oliver ,Each time has seven players  3 chasers  2 beaters  1 keeper and a seeker that's you.,1
Oliver ,There are three kinds of balls. ,1
Oliver ,This one's called the Quaffle.,1
Oliver ,Now  the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. ,1
Oliver ,The keeper  that's me  defends the hoops. ,1
Oliver ,With me so far?,1
Harry  ,I think so. ,1
Harry  ,What are those?,1
Oliver  ,You better take this. ,1
Oliver  ,Careful now  it's comin' back. ,1
Oliver  ,Eh  not bad  Potter  you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. ,1
Harry,What was that?,1
Oliver  ,Bludger. Nasty little buggers. ,1
Oliver  ,But you are a Seeker.,1
Oliver  ,The only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. ,1
Harry ,I like this ball.,1
Oliver ,Ah  you like it now. ,1
Oliver ,Just wait. ,1
Oliver ,It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.,1
Harry  ,What do I do with it?,1
Oliver  ,You catch it...before the other team's seeker. ,1
Oliver  ,You catch this  the game is over. ,1
Oliver  ,You catch this  Potter  and we win.,1
Harry  ,Whoa.,1
Flitwick,One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. ,1
Flitwick,Uh  do you all have your feathers? Good. ,1
Flitwick,Now  uh  don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing  hmm? ,1
Flitwick,The swish and flick. Everyone. ,1
Class,The swish and flick. ,1
Flitwick,Good. ,1
Flitwick,And enunciate. ,1
Flitwick,Wingardium Leviosa. ,1
Flitwick,Off you go then.,1
Draco  ,Wingardium Levio-saaa.,1
Ron  ,Wingardrium Leviosar. ,1
Hermione  ,Stop  stop  stop.,1
Hermione  ,You're going to take someone's eye out. ,1
Hermione  ,Besides  youre saying it wrong. ,1
Hermione  ,It's Leviosa  not Leviosar.,1
Ron  ,You do it then if you're so clever. ,1
Ron  ,Go on  go on.,1
Hermione,Wingardium Leviosa.,1
Flitwick  ,Oh  well done! ,1
Flitwick  ,See here  everyone! ,1
Flitwick  ,Ms. Granger's done it! ,1
Flitwick  ,Oh  splendid!,1
Seamus  ,Wingard Levosa. Wingardly Lev... ,1
Flitwick  ,Whooaaa! Ooh.,1
Harry  ,I think we're going to need another feather over here  Professor.,1
Ron  ,It's Leviosa  not Leviosar. ,1
Ron  ,Honestly  she's a nightmare. ,1
Ron  ,No wonder she hasn't got any friends!,1
Harry,I think she heard you.,1
Harry,Where's Hermione?,1
Neville,Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. ,1
Neville,She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.,1
Quirrell,TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! ,1
Quirrell,T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! ,1
Quirrell,Thought you ought to know. ,1
Dumbledore,SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!,1
Dumbledore, Everyone will please  not panic. ,1
Dumbledore,Now  Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. ,1
Dumbledore,Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.,1
Girl  ,Hufflepuff  this way!,1
Boy  ,Stay together!,1
Percy  ,Gryffindors...keep up please. ,1
Percy  ,And stay alert!,1
Harry  ,How could a troll get in?,1
Ron  ,Not by itself. ,1
Ron  ,Trolls are really stupid. ,1
Ron  ,Probably people playing jokes.,1
Ron  ,What?,1
Harry ,Hermione! ,1
Harry ,She doesn't know!,1
Ron,I think the troll's left the dungeon.,1
Harry ,It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,1
Harry  ,Hermione  move!,1
Hermione,Help! Help!,1
Ron  ,Hey  pea brain! ,1
Hermione ,Ahhh! Help!,1
Harry ,Whooa! Whoa  whoa! ,1
Harry  ,Do something!,1
Ron ,What?,1
Harry  ,Anything! ,1
Harry  ,Hurry up!,1
Hermione,Swish and flick!,1
Ron  ,Wingardium Leviosa! ,1
Ron  ,Cool!,1
Hermione  ,Is it...dead?,1
Harry  ,I don't think so. ,1
Harry  ,Just knocked out. ,1
Harry  , Ew. Troll bogies.,1
McGonagall ,Oh! Oh  my goodness! ,1
McGonagall ,E-Explain yourselves  both of you!,1
Ron and Harry,Well  what it is...,1
Hermione  ,It's my fault  Professor McGonagall. ,1
McGonagall , Ms. Granger?,1
Hermione  ,I went looking for the troll. ,1
Hermione  ,I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. ,1
Hermione  ,But I was wrong. ,1
Hermione  ,If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...,1
Hermione  ,I'd probably be dead.,1
McGonagall  ,Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. ,1
McGonagall  ,I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger. ,1
McGonagall  ,5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.,1
McGonagall  ,As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. ,1
McGonagall  ,Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. ,1
McGonagall  ,5 points...will be awarded to each of you.,1
McGonagall  ,For sheer dumb luck. ,1
Quirrell  ,Perhaps you ought to go...,1
Quirrell  ,M-might wake up...heh.Ahh! Hehe....,1
Harry,Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.,1
Ron,Mind you  we did save her life.,1
Harry,Mind you  she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.,1
Ron,What are friends for?,1
Ron,Take a bit of toast  mate. Go on.,1
Hermione,Ron's right  Harry. ,1
Hermione,You're gonna need your strength today.,1
Harry  ,I'm not hungry.,1
Snape  ,Good luck today  Potter. ,1
Snape  ,Then again  now that you've proven yourself against a troll  a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.,1
Harry  ,That explains the blood.,1
Hermione  ,Blood?,1
Harry  ,Listen  last night  I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.,1
Harry  ,But  he got himself bitten  that's why he's limping.,1
Hermione , But why would anyone go near that dog?,1
Harry  ,The day I was at Gringotts  Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.,1
Harry  , He said it was Hogwarts' business  very secret.,1
Hermione ,So you're saying...,1
Harry ,That's what the dog's guarding. ,1
Harry ,That's what Snape wants.,1
Hermione  ,Bit early for mail  isn't it?,1
Harry  ,But I-I never get mail.,1
Ron  ,Let's open it.,1
Harry  ,It's a broomstick!,1
Ron  ,Thats not just a broomstick  Harry. ,1
Ron  ,It's a Nimbus 2000!,1
Harry  ,But who...?,1
OIiver  ,Scared  Harry?,1
Harry  ,A little.,1
Oliver  ,That's all right. ,1
Oliver  ,I felt the same way before my first game.,1
Harry  ,What happened?,1
Oliver  ,Er  I don't really remember. ,1
Oliver  ,I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in.,1
Oliver  ,Woke up in the hospital a week later.,1
Lee Jordan,Hello  and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! ,1
Lee Jordan,Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!,1
Lee Jordan,The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.,1
Madam Hooch,Now  I want a nice clean game...from all of you. ,1
Lee Jordan,The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. ,1
Lee Jordan,Remember  the snitch is worth 150 points.,1
Lee Jordan,The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.,1
Lee Jordan,The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!,1
Lee Jordan,Angelina Johnson scores! ,1
Lee Jordan,10 points for Gryffindor!,1
Harry  ,Yes! Whoa!,1
Hagrid ,Well done!,1
Lee Jordan,Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.,1
Lee Jordan,Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.,1
Harry ,Yes!,1
Lee Jordan,Another 10 points to Gryffindor!,1
Gryffindors  ,Yay!,1
Flint  ,Give me that! ,1
Crowd  ,Boooo!!,1
Flint,Take that side!,1
Harry  ,Whoa! Whooa!,1
Hagrid  ,What's going on with Harry's broomstick?,1
Hermione  ,It's Snape! ,1
Hermione  ,He's jinxing the broom!,1
Ron  ,Jinxing the broom? ,1
Ron  ,What do we do?,1
Hermione  ,Leave it to me. ,1
Ron  ,Come on  Hermione!,1
Hermione  ,Lacarnum Inflamarae.,1
Man  ,Fire! You're on fire!,1
Snape  ,What? Oh!,1
Ron  ,Go!,1
Hagrid  ,Go go go!,1
Hagrid,Looks like he's gonna be sick.,1
Lee  Jordan,He's got the Snitch! ,1
Lee  Jordan,Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!,1
Madam Hooch ,Gryffindor win!,1
All  ,YAY!,1
Draco  ,No!,1
Hagrid  ,Yes!,1
Hermione  ,Whoo-hoo!,1
Crowd  ,Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! ,1
Hagrid,Nonsense. ,1
Hagrid,Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,1
Harry ,Who knows. ,1
Harry ,Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,1
Hagrid  ,Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,1
Ron  ,Fluffy?,1
Hermione,That thing has a name?,1
Hagrid , Well  of course he's got a name. ,1
Hagrid ,He's mine. ,1
Hagrid ,I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. ,1
Hagrid ,Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the,1
Harry  ,Yes?,1
Hagrid  ,Shouldn'ta said that.  No more questions!,1
Hagrid  ,Don't ask any more questions. ,1
Hagrid  ,That's top secret  that is.,1
Harry  ,But Hagrid  whatever Fluffy's guarding  Snape's trying to steal it!,1
Hagrid  ,Codswallop. ,1
Hagrid  ,Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,1
Hermione  ,Hogwarts teacher or not  I know a curse when I see one. ,1
Hermione  ,I've read all about them. ,1
Hermione  ,You have to keep eye contact. ,1
Hermione  ,And Snape wasn't blinking.,1
Harry ,Exactly.,1
Hagrid,Now  you listen to me  all three of you. ,1
Hagrid,You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. ,1
Hagrid,It's dangerous.,1
Hagrid,What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.,1
Harry ,Nicholas Flamel?,1
Hagrid,I shouldn't have said that. ,1
Hagrid,I should not have said that. ,1
Hagrid,I should not have said that. ,1
Harry,Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,1
Hermione,I don't know.,1
Harry,Knight to E-5.,1
Ron  ,Queen to E-5.,1
Hermione  ,That's totally barbaric!,1
Ron  ,That's wizard's chess. ,1
Ron  ,I see you've packed.,1
Hermione  ,See you haven't.,1
Ron  ,Change of plans. ,1
Ron  ,My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother  Charlie. ,1
Ron  ,He's studying dragons there!,1
Hermione  ,Good. You can help Harry  then. ,1
Hermione  ,He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.,1
Ron  ,We've looked a hundred times!,1

Quirrell , W-what do you m-mean?,1
Snape  ,You know perfectly well what I mean. ,1
Snape  ,We'll have another chat soon...,1
Snape  ,When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.,1
Filch  ,Oh  Professors. I found this  in the Restricted Section. ,1
Filch  ,It's still hot. ,1

Ron,Harry  I know what you're thinking  but don't.,1
Ron,There's something not right about that mirror.,1
Dumbledore  ,Back again  Harry?,1
Dumbledore  ,I see that you  like so many before you  have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. ,1
Dumbledore  ,I trust by now you realize what it does. ,1
Dumbledore  ,Let me give you a clue. ,1
Dumbledore  ,The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself  exactly as he is.,1
Harry  ,So  then it shows us what we want? ,1
Harry  ,Whatever we want?,1
Dumbledore  ,Yes...and no. ,1
Dumbledore  ,It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest  most desperate desires of our hearts. ,1
Dumbledore  ,Now you  who have never known your family  you see them standing beside you. ,1
Dumbledore  ,But remember this  Harry. ,1
Dumbledore  ,This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. ,1
Dumbledore  ,Men have wasted away in front of it  even gone mad. ,1
Dumbledore  ,That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home  and I must ask you not to go looking for it again.,1
Dumbledore  ,It does not do to dwell on dreams  Harry  and forget to live.,1
Hermione,Look at you  playing with your cards.,1
Hermione,Pathetic!,1
Hermione,We've got final exams coming up soon.,1
Ron,I'm ready. Ask me any question.,1
Hermione,Alright  what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?,1
Ron,I forgot.,1
Hermoine,And what  may I ask  do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?,1
Ron,Copy off you.,1
Hermoine,No  you won't.,1
Hermoine,Besides  according to Professor McGonagall  we're to be given special quills bewitched with an Anti Cheating Spell.,1
Ron,That's insulting! ,1
Ron,It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!,1
Ron,Leg-Locker Curse?,1
Harry,Malfoy.,1
Ron,You have got to start standing up to people  Neville.,1
Neville,How? I can barely stand at all!,1
Seamus,I'll do the countercurse!,1
Neville,No  that's all I need!,1
Neville,You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!,1
Seamus,I don't appreciate the insinuation  Longbottom.,1
Seamus,Besides  if anyone cared to notice my eyebrows have completely grown back!,1
Harry,I found him!,1
Ron,Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.,1
Harry,Go on!,1
Ron,For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner  Nicholas Flamel!,1
Harry,I knew the name sound familiar.,1
Harry,I read it on the train that day.,1
Hermione,Follow me!,1
Neville,Hey! Wait! Where are you going?,1
Neville,What about the countercurse?,1
Hermione  ,I had you looking in the wrong section! ,1
Hermione  ,How could I be so stupid? ,1
Hermione  ,I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,1
Ron  ,This is light?,1
Hermione ,Of course! Here it is! ,1
Hermione ,Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!,1
Ron and Harry  ,The what?,1
Hermione  ,Honestly  don't you two read? ,1
Hermione  ,"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. ",1
Hermione  ,It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life  which will make the drinker immortal.,1
Ron  ,Immortal?,1
Hermione  ,It means you'll never die.,1
Ron , I know what it means!,1
Harry, Shh!,1
Hermione ,The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel  the noted alchemist  who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!,1
Hermione ,That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.,1
Hermione ,That's what's under the trapdoor...,1
Hermione ,the Philosopher's Stone!,1
Harry  ,Hagrid!,1
Hagrid,Oh  hello. Sorry  don't wish to be rude  but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. ,1
All 3,We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!,1
Hagrid ,Oh.,1
Harry  ,We think Snape's trying to steal it.,1
Hagrid  ,Snape? Blimey  Harry  you're not still on about him  are you?,1
Harry  ,Hagrid  we know he's after the Stone. ,1
Harry  ,We just don't know why.,1
Hagrid  ,Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! ,1
Hagrid  ,He's not about to steal it!,1
Harry  ,What?,1
Hagrid  ,You heard. Right. ,1
Hagrid  ,Come on  now  I'm a bit preoccupied today.,1
Harry  ,Wait a minute.,1
Harry  ,One of the teachers?,1
Hermione,Of course! There are other things defending the Stone  aren't there?,1
Hermione,Spells and enchantments.,1
Hagrid  ,That's right. ,1
Hagrid  ,Waste of bloody time  if you ask me.,1
Hagrid  ,Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. ,1
Hagrid  ,Hehe  not a soul knows how. ,1
Hagrid  ,Except for me and Dumbledore. ,1
Hagrid  ,I shouldn't have told you that. ,1
Hagrid  ,I shouldn't have told you that. ,1
Hagrid  ,Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! ,1
Harry  ,Uh  Hagrid  what exactly is that?,1
Hagrid  ,That? It's a ... its um...,1
Ron , I know what that is! ,1
Ron ,But Hagrid  how did you get one?,1
Hagrid  ,I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. ,1
Hagrid  ,Seemed quite glad to be rid off it  as a matter of fact.,1
Hermione  ,Is that...a dragon?,1
Ron  ,That's not just a dragon. ,1
Ron  ,That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! ,1
Ron  ,My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,1
Hagrid  ,Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him  look. ,1
Hagrid  ,He knows his mummy. Hehe. ,1
Hagrid  ,Hallo  Norbert.,1
Harry  ,Norbert?,1
Hagrid  ,Yeah  well  he's got to have a name  doesn't he?,1
Hagrid  ,Don't you  Norbert? Dededede.,1
Hagrid  ,Ohh! Oooh  ooh  ooh  well...,1
Hagrid  ,He'll have to be trained up a bit  of course. ,1
Hagrid  ,Who's that?,1
Harry ,Malfoy.,1
Hagrid  ,Oh  dear.,1
Harry,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. ,1
Harry,He told me so the first time I met him.,1
Ron  ,It's crazy. ,1
Ron  ,And worse  Malfoy knows.,1
Harry  ,I don't understand. ,1
Hermione,Is that bad?,1
Ron  ,It's bad.,1
McGonagall,Good evening.,1
McGonagall  ,Nothing  I repeat  nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. ,1
McGonagall  ,Therefore  as punishment for your actions  50 points will be taken.,1
Harry  ,50?!,1
McGonagall ,Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again  all four of you will receive detention.,1
Malfoy,Excuse me  Professor. ,1
Malfoy,Perhaps I heard you wrong. ,1
Malfoy,"I thought you said...""the four of us.""",1
McGonagall,No  you heard me correctly  Mr. Malfoy. ,1
McGonagall,You see  as honorable as your intentions were  you too were out of bed after hours. ,1
McGonagall,You will join your classmates in detention.,1
Filch  ,A pity they let the old punishments die. ,1
Filch  ,There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. ,1
Filch  ,God  I miss the screaming. ,1
Filch  ,You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.,1
Filch  ,He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.,1
Filch  ,A sorry lot this  Hagrid. ,1
Filch  ,Oh  good God  man  you're not still on about that bloody dragon  are you?,1
Hagrid ,Norbert's gone.,1
Hagrid ,Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,1
Hermione  ,Well  that's good  isn't it? ,1
Hermione  ,He'll be with his own kind.,1
Hagrid  ,Yeah  but what if he don't like Romania? ,1
Hagrid  ,What if the other dragons are mean to him?,1
Hagrid  ,He's only a baby  after all.,1
Filch  ,Oh  for Gods sake  pull yourself together  man. ,1
Filch  ,You're going into the forest  after all. ,1
Filch  ,Got to have your wits about you.,1
Malfoy,The forest? I thought that was a joke! ,1
Malfoy,We can't go in there. ,1
Malfoy,Students aren't allowed.,1
Malfoy, And there are...werewolves!,1
Filch , There's more than werewolves in those trees  lad. ,1
Filch ,You can be sure of that.,1
Filch ,Nighty-night.,1
Hagrid ,Right. Let's go.,1
Harry , Hagrid  what's that?,1
Hagrid  ,What we're here for. ,1
Hagrid  ,See that? That's unicorn's blood  that is. ,1
Hagrid  ,I found one dead a few weeks ago. ,1
Hagrid  ,Now  this one's been injured bad by something. ,1
Hagrid  ,So  it's our job to find the poor beast. ,1
Hagrid  ,Ron  Hermione  you'll come with me.,1
Ron,Okay.,1
Hagrid ,And Harry you'll go with Malfoy. ,1
Malfoy,Okay. Then I get Fang!,1
Hagrid ,Fine. Just so you know  he's a bloody coward. },1
Malfoy,You wait till my father hears about this. ,1
Malfoy,This is servant's stuff.,1
Harry ,If I didn't know better  Draco  I'd say you were scared.,1
Malfoy,Scared  Potter?! ,1
Malfoy,Did you hear that? ,1
Malfoy,Come on  Fang.  Scared.,1
Harry ,What is it  Fang?,1
Malfoy,AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! HELP!!!!!,1
Firenze  ,Harry Potter  you must leave. ,1
Firenze  ,You are known to many creatures here. ,1
Firenze  ,The forest is not safe at this time. ,1
Firenze  ,Especially for you.,1
Harry  ,But what was that thing you saved me from?,1
Firenze ,A monstrous creature. ,1
Firenze ,It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. ,1
Firenze ,Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. ,1
Firenze ,But at a terrible price. ,1
Firenze ,You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips  you will have a half-life. ,1
Firenze ,A cursed life.,1
Harry  ,But who would choose such a life?,1
Firenze  ,Can you think of no one?,1
Harry , Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...,1
Harry ,that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?,1
Firenze  ,Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?,1
Harry  ,The Sorcerer's Stone.,1
Hermione  ,Harry!,1
Hagrid ,Hello there  Firenze. ,1
Hagrid ,I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. ,1
Hagrid ,You all right there  Harry? ,1
Firenze  ,Harry Potter  this is where I leave you. ,1
Firenze  ,You're safe now. Good luck.,1
Hermione,You mean  You-Know-Who's out there  right now  in the forest?,1
Harry  ,But he's weak. ,1
Harry  ,He's living off the unicorns. ,1
Harry  ,Don't you see? We had it wrong. ,1
Harry  ,Snape doesn't want the stone for himself  he wants the stone for Voldemort. ,1
Harry  ,With the Elixir of Life  Voldemort will be strong again. ,1
Harry  ,He'll He'll come back. ,1
Ron  ,But if he comes back  you don't think he'll try to kill you  do you?,1
Harry , I think if he'd had the chance  he might have tried to kill me tonight.,1
Ron , And to think  I've been worrying about my Potions final!,1
Hermione  ,Hang on a minute.,1
Hermione  ,We're forgetting one thing. ,1
Hermione  ,Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,1
Hermione  , Dumbledore! ,1
Hermione  ,As long as Dumbledore's around  you're safe. ,1
Hermione  ,As long as Dumbledore's around  you can't be touched. ,1
Hermione , I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful  but I found that rather enjoyable.,1
Ron  ,Speak for yourself.,1
Ron  , All right there  Harry?,1
Harry  ,My scar. It keeps burning.,1
Hermione  ,It's happened before.,1
Harry  ,Not like this.,1
Ron  ,Perhaps you should see the nurse.,1
Harry , I think it's a warning.,1
Harry , It means dangers coming. Uhh!  ,1
Harry ,Oh. Of course!,1
Hermione , What is it?,1
Harry  ,Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon  and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?,1
Harry  ,I mean  how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? ,1
Harry  ,Why didn't I see it before? ,1
Harry  ,Hagrid  who gave you the dragon egg?,1
Harry  , What did he look like?,1
Hagrid  ,I don't know. ,1
Hagrid  ,I never saw his face. ,1
Hagrid  ,He kept his hood up.,1
Harry  ,The stranger  though  you and he must have talked.,1
Hagrid  ,Well  he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. ,1
Hagrid  ,"I told him. I said  ""After Fluffy  a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",1
Harry , And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,1
Hagrid , Well  of course he was interested in Fluffy!,1
Hagrid , How often do you come across a three headed dog  even if you're in the trade? ,1
Hagrid ,"But I told him. I said  ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him.",1
Hagrid ," Take Fluffy  for example  just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",1
Hagrid,  I shouldn't have told you that.,1
Hagrid, Where you going?! Wait!,1
Harry , We have to see Professor Dumbledore  immediately!,1
McGonagall  ,I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. ,1
McGonagall  ,He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.,1
Harry  ,He's gone?! Now? ,1
Harry  ,But this is important! ,1
Harry  ,It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone.,1
McGonagall ,How do you know?,1
Harry  ,Someone's going to try and steal it.,1
McGonagall  ,I don't know how you three found out about the stone  but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. ,1
McGonagall  ,Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. ,1
Harry  ,That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. ,1
Harry  ,It was Snape  which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.,1
Hermione , And with Dumbledore gone,1
Snape , Good afternoon. ,1
Snape ,Now  what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?,1
Hermione  ,Uh...we were just...,1
Snape  ,You want to be careful.,1
Snape  ,People will think you're up to something.,1
Hermione  ,Now what do we do?,1
Harry,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,1
Harry  ,Trevor.,1
Ron  ,Trevor shh!,1
Ron  ,Go  you shouldn't be here!,1
Neville,Neither should you. ,1
Neville,You're sneaking out again  arent you?,1
Harry  ,Now  Neville  listen. We were,1
Neville  ,No! I won't let you!,1
Neville  , You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again!,1
Neville  , I-I'll fight you.,1
Hermione , Neville  I'm really  really sorry about this,1
Hermione , Petrificus Totalus.,1
Ron,You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? ,1
Ron,Brilliant  but scary.,1
Harry , Let's go. Sorry.,1
Hermione  ,Sorry.,1
Ron  ,It's for your own good  you know.,1
Hermione ,Ow! You stood on my foot!,1
Ron  ,Sorry.,1
Hermione  ,Alohomora.,1
Ron  ,Wait a minute...he's.... ,1
Harry,Snoring,1
Harry  ,Snape's already been here. ,1
Harry  ,He's put a spell on the harp.,1
Ron  ,Uh. It's got horrible breath!,1
Harry  ,We have to move its paw.,1
Ron  ,What?!,1
Harry  ,Come on! Okay. Push! ,1
Harry  ,I'll go first. ,1
Harry  ,Don't follow until I give you a sign.,1
Harry  ,If something bad happens  get yourselves out…,1
Harry  ,Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?,1
Hermione ,The harp. It stopped playing.,1
Ron  ,Ew! Yuck! Ugh. ,1
Harry  ,Jump! Go! ,1
Ron  ,Ahh! Whoa. ,1
Ron  ,Lucky this plant-thing is here  really.,1
Harry ,Whoa! Oh. Ahh!,1
Hermione ,Stop moving  both of you. ,1
Hermione ,This is Devil's Snare. ,1
Hermione ,You have to relax. ,1
Hermione ,If you don't  it will only kill you faster.,1
Ron  ,Kill us faster?! ,1
Ron  ,Oh  now I can relax!,1
Ron and Harry,  Hermione!!,1
Ron,Now what are we gonna do?!,1
Hermione,Just relax!,1
Harry  ,Hermione! Where are you?!,1
Hermione,Do what I say. Trust me. ,1
Ron ,Ahh! Harry!,1
Ron,Harry!,1
Hermione,Are you okay?,1
Harry ,Yeah  yeah  I'm fine.,1
Ron ,Help!,1
Hermione  ,He's not relaxing  is he?,1
Harry  ,Apparently not.,1
Ron ,Help! Help me!,1
Hermione  ,We've got to do something!,1
Harry  ,What?,1
Hermione  ,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. ,1
Ron  ,Help!,1
Hermione,Um Devil's Snare  Devil's Scare it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! ,1
Hermione,That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!,1
Hermione,Lumus Solem!,1
Ron  ,Ahhh!,1
Harry ,Ron  are you okay?,1
Ron,Yeah.,1
Harry  ,Okay.,1
Ron,Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,1
Harry  ,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,1
Hermione  ,What is that?,1
Harry,I don't know. ,1
Harry,Sounds like wings.,1
Hermione  ,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,1
Harry  ,They're not birds  they're keys. ,1
Harry  ,And I'll bet one of them fits that door. ,1
Hermione ,What's this all about?,1
Harry  ,I don't know. Strange.,1
Ron   ,Alohomora! ,1
Ron   ,Well  it was worth a try.,1
Hermione  ,Ugh! What're we going to do? ,1
Hermione  ,There must be 1000 keys up there!,1
Ron  ,We're looking for a big old fashioned one. ,1
Ron  ,Probably rusty like the handle.,1
Harry  ,There! I see it!,1
Harry  ,The one with the broken wing!,1
Hermione  ,What's wrong  Harry?,1
Harry  ,It's too simple.,1
Ron  ,Oh  go on  Harry! ,1
Ron  ,If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick  you can! ,1
Ron  ,You're the youngest seeker in a century!,1
Ron  ,This complicates things a bit!,1
Harry  ,Catch the key!,1
Ron  ,Hurry up!,1
Hermione  ,I don't like this. ,1
Hermione  ,I don't like this at all.,1
Harry  ,Where are we? A graveyard.,1
Ron ,This is no graveyard. ,1
Ron ,It's a chessboard.,1
Harry ,There's the door.,1
Hermione  ,Now what do we do?,1
Ron , It's obvious  isn't it? ,1
Ron ,We've got to play our way across the room. ,1
Ron ,All right. Harry  you take the empty Bishop's square. ,1
Ron ,Hermione  you'll be the Queen's side castle. ,1
Ron ,As for me  I'll be a knight.,1
Hermione ,What happens now?,1
Ron,Well  white moves first  and then...we play. ,1
Hermione ,Ron  you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess  do you?,1
Ron  ,You there! D-5!,1
Ron  ,Yes  Hermione  I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!,1
Ron  ,Castle to E-4!,1
Ron  ,Pawn to C-3!,1
Harry  ,Wait a minute.,1
Ron  ,You understand right  Harry. ,1
Ron  ,Once I make my move  the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.,1
Harry  ,No  Ron! No!,1
Hermione , What is it?,1
Harry  ,He's going to sacrifice himself!,1
Hermione ,No  Ron  you can't!,1
Hermione ,There must be another way!,1
Ron,Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?,1
Ron,Harry  it's you that has to go on. I know it. ,1
Ron,Not me  not Hermione  you. ,1
Ron,Knight...to H-3.,1
Ron  ,Check.,1
Ron  ,Ahhhh!,1
Harry  ,RON! ,1
Harry  ,NO! Don't move! Dont forget  we're still playing. ,1
Harry  ,Checkmate. ,1
Harry  ,Take care of Ron. Then  go to the owlery. ,1
Harry  ,Send a message to Dumbledore. ,1
Harry  ,Ron's right...I have to go on.,1
Hermione  ,You'll be okay  Harry. ,1
Hermione  ,You're a great wizard  you really are.,1
Harry  ,Not as good as you.,1
Hermione,Me? Books and cleverness? ,1
Hermione,There are more important things. ,1
Hermione,Friendship  and bravery. ,1
Hermione,And Harry  just be careful.,1
Harry ,You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,1
Quirrell ,Yes. He does seem the type  doesn't he? ,1
Quirrell ,"Next to him  who would suspect  ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?""",1
Harry  ,B-but  that day  during the Quidditch Match  Snape tried to kill me.,1
Quirrell  ,No  dear boy. I tried to kill you! ,1
Quirrell  ,And trust me  if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact  I would have succeeded. ,1
Quirrell  ,Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.,1
Harry  ,Snape was trying to...save me?,1
Quirrell ,I knew you were a danger right from the off. ,1
Quirrell ,Especially after Halloween.,1
Harry ,Th-then you let the troll in.,1
Quirrell  ,Very good Potter  yes. ,1
Quirrell  ,Snape  unfortunately  wasn't fooled. ,1
Quirrell  ,While everyone else was running to the dungeon  he went to the 3rd floor to head me off.,1
Quirrell  ,He  of course  never trusted me again.,1
Quirrell  ,He rarely left me alone. ,1
Quirrell  ,But he doesn't understand. ,1
Quirrell  ,I'm never alone. Never. ,1
Quirrell  ,Now...what does this mirror do? ,1
Quirrell  ,I see what I desire. ,1
Quirrell  ,I see myself holding the stone. ,1
Quirrell  ,But how do I get it?,1
Voldemort ,Use the boy,1
Quirrell  ,Come here  Potter  now!,1
Quirrell  ,Tell me. What do you see?,1
Quirrell ,What is it?! What do you see?!,1
Harry  ,I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. ,1
Harry  ,I've won the house cup.,1
Voldemort,He lies.,1
Quirrell,Tell the truth! What do you see?!,1
Voldemort,Let me speak to him.,1
Quirrell  ,Master  you are not strong enough.,1
Voldemort,I have strength enough for this. ,1
Voldemort,Harry Potter. We meet again.,1
Harry ,Voldemort.,1
Voldemort  ,Yes. You see what I have become? ,1
Voldemort  ,See what I must do to survive? ,1
Voldemort  ,Live off another. A mere parasite. ,1
Voldemort  ,Unicorn blood can sustain me  but it cannot give me a body of my own. ,1
Voldemort  ,But there is something that can. ,1
Voldemort  ,Something  that conveniently enough  lies in your pocket!,1
Voldemort  ,Stop him! ,1
Voldemort  ,Don't be a fool! ,1
Voldemort  ,Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!,1
Harry  ,Never!,1
Voldemort  ,Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. ,1
Voldemort  ,Tell me  Harry  would you like to see your mother and father again? ,1
Voldemort  ,Together  we can bring them back. ,1
Voldemort  ,All I ask for is something in return. ,1
Voldemort  ,That's it  Harry. ,1
Voldemort  ,There is no good and evil. ,1
Voldemort  ,There is only power  and those too weak to seek it. ,1
Voldemort  ,Together  we'll do extraordinary things. ,1
Voldemort  ,Just give me the stone! ,1
Harry  ,You liar!,1
Voldemort,Kill him!,1
Quirrell ,Ahh! Ahh! What is this magic?,1
Voldemort  ,Fool! Get the stone!,1
Quirrell,Ahhhhhhhhhh!,1
Voldemort  ,Arrrhhhhhh!,1
Harry  ,Ahhhhhhhhh!,1
Dumbledore ,Good afternoon  Harry. ,1
Dumbledore ,Ah. Tokens from your admirers?,1
Harry ,Admirers?,1
Dumbledore,What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret  so  naturally  the whole school knows. ,1
Dumbledore,Ah  I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.,1
Harry ,Ron was here? ,1
Harry ,Is he all right? ,1
Harry ,What about Hermione?,1
Dumbledore  ,Fine. They're both just fine.,1
Harry ,But  what happened to the Stone?,1
Dumbledore  ,Relax  dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. ,1
Dumbledore  ,My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.,1
Harry,But Flamel  he'll die  won't he?,1
Dumbledore,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. ,1
Dumbledore,But yes  he will die.,1
Harry  ,How is it I got the Stone  sir? ,1
Harry  ,One minute I was staring in the mirror  and the next...,1
Dumbledore,Ah. You see  only a person who wanted to find the Stone  find it  but not use it  would be able to get it. ,1
Dumbledore,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. ,1
Dumbledore,And between you and me thats saying something.,1
Harry  ,Does that mean  with the Stone gone  I mean  that Voldemort can never come back?,1
Dumbledore ,Ah  I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. ,1
Dumbledore ,Harry  do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?,1
Dumbledore ,It was because of your mother. ,1
Dumbledore ,She sacrificed herself for you  and that kind of act leaves a mark. ,1
Dumbledore ,No  no  this kind of mark cannot be seen.,1
Dumbledore ,It lives in your very skin.,1
Harry ,What is it?,1
Dumbledore,Love  Harry  love. ,1
Dumbledore,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. ,1
Dumbledore,I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one  and since then I have lost my liking for them. ,1
